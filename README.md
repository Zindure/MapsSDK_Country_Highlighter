 Test Maps

A Kotlin project that aims to create an interactive map of the world using the Maps SDK.

It uses a list of country geojsons (files and list of files) which act as the overlay for each country, as to provide visual feedback to touching the corresponding country.

It also pulls data from a database for each country, here represented by a file in development.



Notes : Please add local.properties file containing the following

```
sdk.dir=C\:\\Users\\PDS12\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR MAPS_API_KEY
```
